          We take a straightforward approach to the warranty policy. We clarify
          that our guarantee does not cover labor charges associated with the
          installation or removal of items. Additionally, it doesn&apos;t cover
          other expenses like towing fees, rental car charges, or additional
          repairs required as a result of using faulty or inappropriate parts.
          Our company aims to develop relationships based on trust and customer
          satisfaction, not only by selling parts. This corporate concept is
          clearly reflected in Engines & Drivetrain warranty policy. We continue
          to offer assistance and support to our clients long after the sale
          finalizes to give them the finest possible service.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          Our warranty program offers our clients protection against defective
          items and peace of mind, among other advantages. They can shop
          confidently, knowing that every component will perform to the highest
          standards and that, should any issues arise, we&apos;ll be here to

          Return Process
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          We are aware that returning a part occasionally can be difficult.
          Because of this, we work hard to make the return procedure as simple
          as possible. We ask that our clients thoroughly explain the problem
          they&apos;ve encountered to make returns go more smoothly. Thanks to
          your information, we can better identify the nature of the issue,
          address it, and improve our service.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          However, if a returned part doesn&apos;t adhere to the guidelines
          specified in our return policy, a restocking fee of 25% of the total
          paid amount assesses. By taking this action, we can better manage our
          inventories and provide for you in the future.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          Ordering the correct part is crucial, which cannot be emphasized
          sufficiently. We firmly advise our customers to consult a mechanic or
          other automotive expert before placing an order to avoid future
          issues. We regrettably cannot accept returns or issue refunds for
          parts which are ordered incorrectly. Please be aware that to be
          eligible for a refund or exchange, all claims must be returned within
          30 days of delivery.

          Warranty Coverage on Transmissions
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          The transmission is a critical component of an automobile&apos;s
          intricate ecosystem. It is the brains behind turning the power of your
          engine into motion. Engines & Drivetrain recognizes the importance of
          this job and specifically emphasizes our warranty coverage for
          transmissions, which play a crucial role in the overall operation of
          your car.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          Our transmission warranty coverage goes above and beyond the norm. We
          know a transmission&apos;s efficiency extends beyond functional gears
          and bearings. It entails paying close attention to every component
          supporting efficient power transfer from your engine to your wheels.
          Let&apos;s clarify the function and intricacy of transmissions before
          getting into the complexities of our transmission guarantee. Moreover,
          an automatic gearbox comprises many gears, bearings, seals, gaskets,
          and fluid lines, just a few of the many different parts. The assembly
          is a mechanical wonder that ensures your car&apos;s motion because
          each component is essential for the transmission to operate correctly.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          However, comprehensive and robust warranty coverage is required due to
          the complicated assembly&apos;s susceptibility to wear and tear.
          Moreover, our dedication to you extends to ensuring that each
          component works in unison to give you a safe and dependable driving
          experience. Our transmission guarantee was explicitly created to
          ensure it would operate correctly, with smooth gear and bearing
          motion. However, the duty does not end there. Before assembling the
          transmission, we advise clients to clean all its parts, including the
          oil pan, properly. Doing this will make you confident that any
          leftover impurities won&apos;t affect how well your new part works.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          Additionally, it is essential to repair all gaskets and seals before
          installing the transmission. This procedure reduces the possibility of
          any leaks that can result in fluid loss and possible harm. The cooler
          and lines should also undergo a thorough inspection, flush, and flow
          test. This guarantees that the cooling system, essential to
          maintaining the transmission&apos;s health, is operating as it should.
          In addition, the warranty coverage changes regarding manual
          transmissions to consider their particular characteristics. The
          replacement of the clutch, pressure plate, and slave
          cylinder—essential components of the manual transmission system—is
          advised by the policy. Prior to installation, the flywheel should also
          be refinished to guarantee optimum clutch engagement and seamless gear
          changes.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          It&apos;s also crucial to remember that keeping your
          transmission&apos;s fluid level at the right level is essential for
          its longevity and effective operation. Moreover, it doesn&apos;t
          matter if the transmission is automatic or manual; fluid levels must
          be monitored and filled off as necessary to prevent overheating and
          guarantee seamless gear changes. Additionally, it is essential to
          recognize that not all parts are covered by our warranty, even though
          we guarantee the performance of the fundamental transmission
          components. While turbo seals, for example, are a component of the
          transmission assembly, they are not warranted to remain faultless and
          need to be replaced within a specific time range.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          Our extensive warranty coverage for transmissions aligns with our
          broader dedication to excellence, dependability, and client happiness.
          It intends to offer a hassle-free ownership experience, allowing you
          to concentrate on the road ahead rather than the components inside
          your engine. We will support every mile of your journey as we make
          sure it is as smooth as a transmission covered by a Engines &
          Drivetrain warranty. Trust in us, and let&apos;s travel through the
          automotive world together.

            available or refunding customer with the purchase price. Swap
