          Engines & Drivetrain knows that the situation may be erratic and that,
          occasionally, you may need to cancel an order. We&apos;ve got you
          covered, so don&apos;t worry! Before receiving our formal order
          confirmation, you are free to cancel your order anytime.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          An order cannot be canceled since we want to provide quick and
          efficient service, which means once it has been verified, it is
          quickly processed for shipping. This is because we move quickly to
          make sure your car components get to you as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          Please be aware of our order processing schedule over the weekends.
          Orders placed between Friday at 5 EST (2:00 PST) and Monday at 9 EST
          (6:00 PST) cannot be canceled. This is because we try to process
          orders and prepare them for shipping over the weekend.

        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          We do this to shorten wait times and guarantee that your items are

          ordering a part to do a quick repair or just stocking up, you can

          is delivered, kindly refuse the delivery and arrange for the carrier
          to return the item to the sender as soon as possible. We regrettably

          We ask that you properly check each shipment after receiving your
          order to look for missing, harmed, or inadvertent parts. Please
          repackage the item(s) in the original shipping container if you
          unluckily receive a damaged or wrong item and follow the instructions
          in our return policy, which are listed below:
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          1. If you receive a damaged part, then do not accept the package.
          Contact the shipper immediately and return it to the sender.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          2. If a damaged package is left in your absence by the shipper,
          immediately contact the shipping company to arrange its return to the
          sender.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4 font-display text-base">
          3. If you discover missing, damaged, or incorrect parts upon receipt,

          helps prevent you from being charged for both receipt and return
          freight.

          securely. To avoid shipment damage, we strongly advise following any
          special packaging recommendations. We won&apos;t be liable if your
          return is damaged because of poor packaging.

          Refunds usually process and credit within 24 to 48 hours of our
          warehouse receiving your returned products. The refund will be
          credited to the same payment method you used for the original
          purchase. When your refund is finalized, a &quot;credit approved&quot;
          email will be sent to you. Although it can take 1–7 business days for
          your banking institution to display the credit in your account, kindly
          be aware of this possibility.
